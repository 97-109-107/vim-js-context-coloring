#Vim JavaScript Context Coloring

##Description

This is a plugin for the Vim text editor to highlight JavaScript code 
according to its scope. This was inspired by an idea by Douglas Crockford
in his [presentation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkZFtimgAcM) at YUIConf 2012.
(See from around the 16 minute mark onwards.)

##Usage

When the JSContextColor command is executed, the current buffer is colorized
according to the scope of the code. The command can either be manually 
executed or you can configure it to be executde when events occur. 
Eg. You can add this to your vimrc:

  augroup JSCC
      au!
      au TextChangedI,TextChanged *.js JSContextColor
  augroup END


##Requirements

The plugin relies on Git, NodeJS and NPM being installed. If you have a recent
version of NodeJS, NPM will have been installed automatically.

##Installation

### Using Pathogen.

1. Clone the repo from GitHub into your 'bundle' directory:

2. In the repo's root directory, run the command:

	npm install

##Configuration

To change the colors, in your .vimrc, set the `g:funcjs_colors` variable to a list of colors, eg:

	let g:funcjs_colors = [ 252, 10, 11, 172, 1, 161, 63 ]
